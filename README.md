Welcome to my portfolio! I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **AI Enthusiast** with a background in **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)**. This portfolio showcases some of the models I have built, along with my journey in the world of AI and Machine Learning.

## üöÄ About Me

I specialize in developing and deploying machine learning models to solve real-world problems. My expertise includes:

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs.
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.
- **Deployment**: Docker, Streamlit, Flask, AWS, Hugging Face Spaces.

This repository is a collection of my projects, code, and machine learning models.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Projects

Below are some of the machine learning models I‚Äôve built:

### 1. **[Model Name 1](https://link-to-project)**
- **Description**: A brief description of the model and what problem it solves.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, etc.
- **Demo**: [Live Demo](link-to-deployed-model) (if applicable)

#### Key Features:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

#### Code & Instructions:
You can view the code [here](link-to-github-repo).
To run the model locally, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
